2. Installing
--------------
	Okay, I aint too good at telling people how this works, but I will try my best!
First, go to your Quake 2 folder, and creat a folder called obk (NOTE: The name MUST be obk, or when you connect to a server running the mod you will have problems)
after that, extract all the files in obk_b001.zip into that folder.  When that is done, make a shortcut of quake2.exe and place it in the obk folder.
when the shortcut is in the obk foler, right mouse click on it, and go to properties.  A small window will appear,
There should be a string that looks like this: C:\Quake2\quake2.exe (Or wherever you put Quake 2) no add to that string this: +game obk +deathmatch 1 +map q2dm1
That should start a server (NON DEDICATED) in the obk mod.  If you want to run a dedicated server, do this: +dedicated 1 +game obk +deathmatch 1 +map q2dm1

Thats it, hope that helps!
